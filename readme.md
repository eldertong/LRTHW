# Learning Ruby the Hard Way

Learn Ruby The Hard Way is the same highly popular way for total beginners to finally learn how to code but for the Ruby programming language. Learn Ruby The Hard Way takes you from absolute zero to able to read and write basic Ruby to then understand other books on Ruby. No experience necessary to begin, and you can even try the book out for free to see if the method works for you. If you've always wanted to learn to code but have no idea where to begin, then this book is for you. https://learnrubythehardway.org/
