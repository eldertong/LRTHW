# number os people is actually 2 but in binary 2 is 10

# this is a string unsing the above variable

# defines binary

# defines do not to don't  someone does not like contractions

# sting using the above variables
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}."

# prints x and y string
puts x
puts y

# prints above string in a more conversational manner
puts "I said: #{x}."

# defines halarious to false but i set it to true
hilarious = true
# string with above definition
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny?! #{hilarious}"

# prints above string

# defines w and e
w = "This is the left side of..."

# prints w and e
puts w + e

# w + e makes a sentence out of the 2 definitions
# using ' instead of " works so long as you do not have a contraction'
